## Project: Web Scraper
### Filename
scraper.py

### Description
After finishing the project, you’ll know how to send HTTP-requests and process the responses, how to work with an external library, library documentation, and how to use it for parsing the website data. You will also find out how to make your program save results to a file with the help of Python.

You will create a function that takes a website address and a number of webpages as input arguments and then goes all over the website saving every news article on the page to a separate .txt file on your computer.

Stages:

1) Send an HTTP request, process the results, and learn about response status codes.
2) Get familiar with the BeautifulSoup library. Learn how to parse simple data from a webpage.
3) Learn to work with files.
4) Create a function that scrapes every article on a page with a for loop.
5) Improve the function by adding ‘webpage number’ and 'article type' parameters.


## Project: Easy Rider Bus Company
### Filename
easy_rider.py

### Description
In addition to writing your own programs to test data consistency and correctness, you will practice reading documentation, working with data in JSON format, and creating lists, iterators, and dictionaries. You will also learn how to work with set methods, the itertools library, and the regular expression library.

You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation!

Stages:

1) Check that the types of variables match and all the required fields are filled.
2) Check if the syntax is correct. This is a good opportunity to use the ''re'' library.
3) Make sure that the information about the bus lines and the number of stops is correct.
4) Find all departure stations, final stops, and transfer stops to fill in the missing specifications.
5) Make sure that the stops follow each other and their estimated arrival times make sense.
6) Check that there are no wrongly marked on-demand stops.


## Project: Static Code Analyzer
### Filename
code_analyzer.py

### Description
After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of how static source code analyzers work. You will also get more experience with object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and file processing. You will practice using the abstract syntax tree, and, last but not least, learn more about the rules of Python code style.

In this project, you will create a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code. You will get a general idea of static code analysis and expand your competence in Python.

Stages:

1) Write a program that performs a simple code style check and finds lines that are too long.
2) Add checks for proper use of indentation, semicolons, spaces before comments, TODOs, and blank lines.
3) Learn how to work with multiple files and directories and process command-line arguments.
4) Use regular expressions to check proper naming.
5) Use the Abstract Syntax Tree to polish your program. Your own tool for analyzing code style issues is ready to use!


## Project: Flashcards App
### Filename
flashcards.py

### Description
In this project, you will learn how to work with files and call them from the command line.

When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.

Stages:

1) Display information about a single card on the screen.
2) Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the user’s answer on the screen.
3) Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.
4) Learn to use hashtables, display key values, and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.
5) Work with files: create a menu that allows you to add, delete, save, and upload saved cards in your game.
6) Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve.
7) Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments.
