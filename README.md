## Web Scraper Project

### Description
You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation!

Stage 1: Check that the types of variables match and all the required fields are filled.
Stage 2: Check if the syntax is correct. This is a good opportunity to use the ''re'' library.
Stage 3: Make sure that the information about the bus lines and the number of stops is correct.
Stage 4: Find all departure stations, final stops, and transfer stops to fill in the missing specifications.
Stage 5: Make sure that the stops follow each other and their estimated arrival times make sense.
Stage 6: Check that there are no wrongly marked on-demand stops.
